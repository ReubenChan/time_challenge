# time_challenge

 In the section on Functions, we looked at 2 different ways to calculate the factorial
 of a number.  We used an iterative approach, and also used a recursive function.

 This challenge is to use the timeit module to see which performs better.

 The two functions appear below.

 Hint: change the number of iterations to 1,000 or 10,000.  The default
 of one million will take a long time to run.
